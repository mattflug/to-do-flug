    // Todo Dependency Injection for our DAO Layer
    /*
    Dependency injection is something that's very important in Spring, it's how spring is able to manage all of our
    classes and provide the functionality that it does. There are 2 major ways we do dependency injection

    Constructor Injection
        - Preferred way to do dependency injection in spring
        - More secure than Setter Injection
        - Creates mandatory dependencies
        - Used in 90% of standard circumstances

    Setter Injection
        - Injecting a dependency through a setter method as opposed to a constructor
        - Used for optional dependencies
        - Used to resolve circular dependencies (Class A depends on Class B with also depends on Class A)

    Field Injection (Hidden 3rd form)
        - Generally avoid using this
        - This is accomplished by just putting @Autowired over a field
        - Can create hidden dependencies and hide the level of complexity for a class
     */

    // Todo Create a new ice cream entry method

    How do we get a specific ice cream record?
    If we're working with a RESTful API, it makes sense for our URLs follow a specific pattern
    Normally if you're trying to access all records of a specific type you'll go to /icecream (normally plural noun)
    To access a specific resource from that larger list it would be /icecream/2 (path variable)
    To filter the whole collection of resources you'd normally use query parameters /icecream?dairy_free=true

    // I imagine I will be able to update an ice cream record by the data that is passed into the http request
    // Since I'm accessing a single resource, it makes sense that it should use a path variable to denote the
    // resource to be updated.

    // the request
